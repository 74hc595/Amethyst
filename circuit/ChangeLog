Rev 1.2 - December 17, 2019
===========================
- Switch back to FT230X, didn't need the extra complexity
- Move AVRISP/SPI1 switch, add more labels
- Line up SPI0/SPI1 connectors with Analog connector

Rev 1.1 - September 8, 2019
===========================
- Ortholinear 47-key keyboard layout
- Switch from FT230X to FT231X and connect /RESET to /DTR
  (circuit based on SparkFun's BOB-13263)
- Connect /RESET to SPI1 via switch, allowing ISP programming without
  removing cover
- Connect AVR PD1 to shift register /CE lines instead of video mixer
- Changed mounting holes to M2.5 and repositioned
- Moved +5V/GND testpoints
- Moved power LED. Now vertically aligned with reset button
- Empty board space near SPI0 and SPI1 ports may allow for internal
  expansion boards (SPI EEPROM, etc)
