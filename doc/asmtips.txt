AVR assembler tips
==================

The following instructions do NOT modify the SREG flags:
  - Any jump (JMP, RJMP, IJMP, EIJMP)
  - Any call (CALL, RCALL, ICALL, EICALL)
  - Any return (RET, RETI; RETI only modifies I)
  - Any conditional skip (CPSE, SBRC, SBRS, SBIC, SBIS)
  - Any branch instruction (BRxx)
  - Some register operations: LDI, MOV, MOVW, SER, SWAP
  - Any memory load/store (LD/LDS/LDD, LPM, ELPM, ST/STS/STD, SPM, PUSH, POP)
  - Any I/O register operation (IN, OUT, SBI, CBI)
  - BLD, BREAK, NOP, SLEEP, WDR

The following instructions take 2 or more cycles:
  - SBI, CBI (these seem like they should be single-cycle, but they aren't!)
  - ADIW, SBIW
  - Any multiply (MUL, MULS, MULSU, FMUL, FMULS, FMULSU)
  - Any jump (RJMP, IJMP, EIJMP take 2 cycles; JMP takes 3 cycles)
  - Any call (RCALL, ICALL take 3 cycles; EICALL, CALL take 4 cycles)
  - Any RAM load/store (LD, LDS, LDD, ST, STS, STD, PUSH, POP)
  - Returns take 3 cycles (RET, RETI)
  - ROM loads take 3 cycles (LPM, ELPM)
  - Any branch if the condition is true (BRxx)
  - Any skip if the condition is true (CPSE, SBRC, SBRS, SBIC, SBRS)
      (3 cycles if condition is true and next instruction is 2 words)
  - SPM (see reference manual)

The following instructions take 2 words:
  - CALL, JMP, LDS, STS

The following instructions have register restrictions:
  - ADIW SBIW                                    r25:r24, X, Y, Z
  - ANDI CBR CPI LDI MULS ORI SBCI SBR SER SUBI  r16-r31 only
  - FMUL FMULS FMULSU MULSU                      r16-r23 only
  - IJMP EIJMP ICALL EICALL LPM                  Z implied
  - LDD STD                                      Y and Z only for second operand
  - SPM                                          see reference manual

The following I/O registers can be accessed with IN, OUT, SBI, CBI:
  - PINA, DDRA, PORTA, PINB, DDRB, PORTB, PINC, DDRC, PORTC, PIND, DDRD, PORTD
  - TIFR0, TIFR1, TIFR2, TIFR3
  - PCIFR, EIFR, EIMSK, GPIOR0, EECR

In addition to the previous I/O registers, the following I/O registers can be
accessed with IN and OUT:
  - EEDR, EEAR
  - GTCCR
  - TCCR0A, TCCR0B, TCNT0, OCR0A, OCR0B
  - GPIOR1, GPIOR2
  - SPCR0, SPSR0, SPDR0
  - ACSR, OCDR, SMCR, MCUSR, MCUCR, SPMCSR, RAMPZ, SPL, SPH, SREG
